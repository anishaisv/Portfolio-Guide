### üß† Machine Learning Projects

Explore my Machine Learning projects, where I apply various algorithms to solve real-world problems. Through predictive models like real estate price prediction, I use techniques such as feature engineering, linear regression, and model optimization to generate insights and support decision-making.

| Project | Completion Date | Tools Used | Description |
|---------|-----------------|------------|-------------|
| üè† **[Real Estate Price Prediction](https://github.com/anishaisv/Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/Real%20Estate%20price%20prediction%20project/Real%20Estate%20price%20prediction.ipynb)**  | Oct 2024 | Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Jupyter Notebook | Built a regression model using the Bangalore home prices dataset from Kaggle. Covered key data science concepts including data cleaning, outlier removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning, and K-Fold cross-validation. |
| üè¶ **[Logistic Regression Model](https://github.com/anishaisv/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Building%20a%20Logistic%20Regression%20-%20Exercise-checkpoint.ipynb)** | [Insert Date] | Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Jupyter Notebook | Developed a logistic regression model to predict if a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on marketing data. The model was fitted using Statsmodels, and evaluation metrics such as pseudo R-squared, log-likelihood, and p-values. |
| üè° **[Multiple Linear Regression with Dummies](https://github.com/anishaisv/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Multiple%20Linear%20Regression%20with%20Dummies%20Exercise-checkpoint.ipynb)** | [Insert Date] | Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook | Implemented a multiple linear regression model to predict real estate prices using 'size', 'year', and a dummy variable for 'view'. Evaluated the model's distribution using key performance metrics. |
| üî¥ **[Customer Churn Prediction](https://github.com/anishaisv/Machine-Learning/blob/main/customer%20churn%20prediction-checkpoint.ipynb)** | May 2021 | Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn | Built a model to predict customer churn using demographic and usage data. Applied classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees) and evaluated model performance. Visualized key features influencing churn and assessed the distribution of features with histograms. |
